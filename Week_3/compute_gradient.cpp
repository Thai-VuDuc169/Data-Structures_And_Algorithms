/*
1)	Compute Gradient of an image  
3)	Generate binary numbers between 1 to n using a queue 
4)	Note: For the first exercise, you can use lib as OpenCV for reading and writing an image. 
To compute Gradient of an image, please study what is the gradient of image 
and implement the filter to compute the Gradient according to x and y axis.
