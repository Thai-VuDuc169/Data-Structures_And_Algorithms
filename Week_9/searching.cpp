/*
1 Calculate hash values of keys: 1892, 1921, 2007, 3456 using different methods of hashing 
2) What is collision ? Explain various techniques to resolve a collision.
Which technique do you think better and why ?  
3) Consider a hash table with size = 10, using linear probing, 
insert the key 27, 72, 63, 42, 36, 18, 29, 101 into the table 
4) Implement a list of students, each student is a record 
with following information: ID (value of 4 digits), name. 
We would like to directly search the student according to his ID, 
if the number of students N = 500, and table size M = 550.  
- Choose a suitable method (open addressing / chained hashing table)  
- Define list structure, hash table  
- Define function to store a student  
- Define a function to search a student given his ID
